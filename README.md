**STEPS**
1) Go to "code" and "download zip"

5) Same as the previous 'Nude Alexios Enhanced Muscle Definition' and 'Nude Layer' drop the 'Outfit Customizer' forger file in ForgerPatches folder. Rescan and check for **Outfit Customizer.** Once you have Outfit Customizer installed, look for *'Outfit Dress'* and check it. A window will pop up with more options. Highlight *'None'* and click select
6) From there your changes should be applied and ready
7) Boot up the game, and check that it's all applied.

Thank you to ilikedetectives for extracting the files and dealing with the forger codes. Thank you to hypermorphic for leaving behind a great legacy of the current Assassin's Creed modding scene, without you, none of this would have been possible. And we would also like to extend our gratitude to Makacha for the patience to both teach and help us along the way through texture modding and coding. Last but not least, we give our gratitude to all those that inspire us, including those that critize us, if anything, it has given us strength to do what we do and do so with enjoyment. Thank you to all.
