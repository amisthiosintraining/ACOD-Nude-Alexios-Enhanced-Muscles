## Installation Steps
1) Go to "code" and "download zip"

3) Copy and paste the four items **NudeAlexiosEnhancedMuscleDefinition** folder, **Nude_Alexios_Enhanced_Muscle_Definition-v2.forger2**, **NudeLayer** folder and **Nude_Layer-v1.forger2** into "ForgerPatches" folder where ACOdyssey.exe is.
4) Make sure you have Outfit Customizer installed. If you haven't downloaded it, do so <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/mods/85">here</a>.
5) Same as the previous 'Nude Alexios Enhanced Muscle Definition' and 'Nude Layer' drop the 'Outfit Customizer' forger file in ForgerPatches folder. Rescan and check for **Outfit Customizer.** Once you have Outfit Customizer installed, look for *'Outfit Dress'* and check it. A window will pop up with more options. Highlight *'None'* and click select
6) From there your changes should be applied and ready
7) Boot up the game, and check that it's all applied.
8) If you don't see the mod applied, sometimes unchecking those three mods and rechecking helps. Do so in this order 'Nude Alexios Enhanced Muscle Definition', 'Nude Layer' and lastly 'Outfit Customizer'.

*Thank you to ilikedetectives for taking the time to dig for textures and forger codes. To hypermorphic for leaving behind a great legacy of a thriving Assassin's Creed modding community, without you, none of this would have been possible. To Makacha for the patience to both teach and help us along the way to texture modding and coding. Last but not least, we would like to extend our gratitude to all those that inspire us, including those that critisize us with the intent to second guess ourselves. If anything, it has given us the strength to continue what we do, and do so with pride.*
